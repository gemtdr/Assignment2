First, the user can pick to either run the program using a regular linked list or in stack format. 
Regular linked list has full functionality -- pop front/back, push front/back, insert/delete at any point, etc.
Stacked means values can only be accessed from the top, but I am still able to print values. Stack mode also has a function where I can find the average.
